Graph API Version
v22.0
Ad Creative
The instagram_actor_id field for the act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives has been deprecated for v22.0 and will be deprecated for all versions September 9, 2025. Please migrate your API calls to use the instagram_user_id field. Learn more in the v22.0 API Changelog and our News for Developers blog post.

Format which provides layout and contains content for the ad. To see available ad creatives, visit Ads Guide. The guide also contains information on size requirements for each ad unit. See also Facebook for Business and Inline page post creation blog post.

Ads About Social Issues, Elections, and Politics
Advertisers running ads about social issues, elections, and politics need to specify special_ad_categories while creating an ad campaign. In addition, businesses still have to set authorization_category to flag at the ad creative level. Learn more about the requirements.

Examples
For example, get information about an ad creative, such as the ID of the newly created unpublished page post:

curl -G \
  -d 'fields=name,object_story_id' \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/<CREATIVE_ID>
Create a link ad:

curl \
  -F 'name=Sample Creative' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={ 
    "link_data": { 
      "image_hash": "<IMAGE_HASH>", 
      "link": "<URL>", 
      "message": "try it out" 
    }, 
    "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>" 
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
You can replace picture with image_hash to specify an image from your ad account's image library. You can also specify image cropping with image_crops in link_data. See Image Crop, Reference.

To create a political ad creative, use the field authorization_category with value POLITICAL. For example:

curl \
  -F 'authorization_category=POLITICAL' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={
    ...
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
Beginning January 9, 2024, to create an issue, electoral, or political ad creative that uses media that is digitally created or altered, use the authorization_category field with the POLITICAL_WITH_DIGITALLY_CREATED_MEDIA value. For example:

curl \
  -F 'authorization_category=POLITICAL_WITH_DIGITALLY_CREATED_MEDIA' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={
    ...
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives

When making a post call, add relevant fields as below to creative creation api spec. For non-applicable compliance categories, it can be ignored.

Example:

"regional_regulation_disclaimer_spec": {
  "taiwan_finserv": {
    "taiwan_finserv_beneficiary_id": <id>,
    "taiwan_finserv_funder_id": <id>
  },
  "australia_finserv": {
    "australia_finserv_beneficiary_id": <id>,
    "australia_finserv_payer_id": <id>
  },
  "taiwan_universal": {
    "taiwan_universal_beneficiary_id": <id>,
    "taiwan_universal_payer_id": <id>
  }
}
Fetching Regional Regulation Disclaimer Spec The value can be retrieved by making a GET call to <creative_id>/regional_regulation_disclaimer_spec

Important:

When using an existing creative for an ad, the disclaimer of the creative must be identical to that of its parent ad set.

For example, if an advertiser has an ad set that declares:

regional_regulated_categories: [TAIWAN_UNIVERSAL]
regional_regulation_identities: [
  "taiwan_universal_beneficiary": 123,
  "taiwan_universal_payer": 456
]
A existing creative can only be used under the ad of this ad set if it has the following disclaimer spec:

"regional_regulation_disclaimer_spec": {
  "taiwan_universal": {
    "taiwan_universal_beneficiary_id": 123,
    "taiwan_universal_payer_id": 456
  }
}
Ensure that the disclaimer spec of the creative matches the ad set's requirements to maintain compliance with regional regulations or you will encounter Error #3858325.

Creating
Define creative as part of an ad set or standalone. In either case, we store your ad creative in your ad account's creative library to use in ads. If you try to add an creative that isn't unique, we do not generate it and return the creative ID of the existing ad creative. For example, create a Link Ad with a call to action:

curl \
  -F 'name=Sample Creative' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={ 
    "link_data": { 
      "call_to_action": {"type":"SIGN_UP","value":{"link":"<URL>"}}, 
      "link": "<URL>", 
      "message": "try it out" 
    }, 
    "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>" 
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
You use link_caption to pass the call to action object. By doing this, you can customize the call to action caption. To customize the call to action description, pass link_description in the call to action object.

Create a carousel ad

curl \
  -F 'name=Sample Creative' \
  -F 'object_story_spec={ 
    "link_data": { 
      "child_attachments": [ 
        { 
          "description": "$8.99", 
          "image_hash": "<IMAGE_HASH>", 
          "link": "https:\/\/www.link.com\/product1", 
          "name": "Product 1", 
          "video_id": "<VIDEO_ID>" 
        }, 
        { 
          "description": "$9.99", 
          "image_hash": "<IMAGE_HASH>", 
          "link": "https:\/\/www.link.com\/product2", 
          "name": "Product 2", 
          "video_id": "<VIDEO_ID>" 
        }, 
        { 
          "description": "$10.99", 
          "image_hash": "<IMAGE_HASH>", 
          "link": "https:\/\/www.link.com\/product3", 
          "name": "Product 3" 
        } 
      ], 
      "link": "<URL>" 
    }, 
    "page_id": "<PAGE_ID>" 
  }' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
Partnership Ads Posts
As a partnership ads sponsor, you can create ads with posts where your brand is tagged. Create a campaign, ad set, as ads as your normally do. The only difference is in the ad creative.

Set the sponsor_page_id field for facebook_branded_content and/or the sponsor_id field for instagram_branded_content in the ad creative. For example:

curl \
 -F 'access_token=<TOKEN>' \
 -F 'facebook_branded_content':{'sponsor_page_id=<PAGE_ID>'}\
 // OR
 -F 'instagram_branded_content':{'sponsor_id=<Instagram_user_ID>'}\
 -F 'object_story_id=<OBJECT_STORY_ID>' \
https://graph.facebook.com/<VERSION>/<ACCOUNT_ID>/adcreatives
Where object_story_id is the post id in the format of: postOwnerID_postID.

Inline Page Post Creation
Most ad creatives rely on page posts for creative content. While you may create page posts separately then reference them by ID, it is easier to create them in the same call you use to provide ad creative. Specify the page post content with object_story_spec which creates an unpublished page post. See Inline Page Post, Blog.

You can get the new ID by retrieving object_story_id from the ad creative. To get post ids created with object_story_spec through /promotable_posts, pass include_inline=true in your HTTP GET. If include_inline value is false, we don't return any ids.

Get Related Objects
Many ad creatives require object_id for a relevant Facebook object, app ID, or page tab's URL. See Connection Objects for more information.
