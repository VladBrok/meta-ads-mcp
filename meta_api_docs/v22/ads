execution_options
list<enum{validate_only, synchronous_ad_review, include_recommendations}>
Default value: Set
An execution setting
validate_only: when this option is specified, the API call will not perform the mutation but will run through the validation rules against values of each field.
include_recommendations: this option cannot be used by itself. When this option is used, recommendations for ad object's configuration will be included. A separate section recommendations will be included in the response, but only if recommendations for this specification exist.
synchronous_ad_review: this option should not be used by itself. It should always be specified with validate_only. When these options are specified, the API call will perform Ads Integrity validations, which include message language checking, image 20% text rule, and so on, as well as the validation logics.
If the call passes validation or review, response will be {"success": true}. If the call does not pass, an error will be returned with more details. These options can be used to improve any UI to display errors to the user much sooner, e.g. as soon as a new value is typed into any field corresponding to this ad object, rather than at the upload/save stage, or after review.

include_demolink_hashes
boolean
Include the demolink hashes.

name
string
Name of the ad.

RequiredSupports Emoji
priority
int64
Priority

source_ad_id
numeric string or integer
ID of the source Ad, if applicable.

status
enum{ACTIVE, PAUSED, DELETED, ARCHIVED}
Only ACTIVE and PAUSED are valid during creation. Other statuses can be used for update. When an ad is created, it will first go through ad review, and will have the ad status PENDING_REVIEW before it finishes review and reverts back to your selected status of ACTIVE or PAUSED. During testing, it is recommended to set ads to a PAUSED status so as to not incur accidental spend.

tracking_specs
Object
With Tracking Specs, you log actions taken by people on your ad. See Tracking and Conversion Specs.
