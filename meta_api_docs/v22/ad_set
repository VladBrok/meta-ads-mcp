Ad Set
An ad set is a group of ads that share the same daily or lifetime budget, schedule, bid type, bid info, and targeting data. Ad sets enable you to group ads according to your criteria, and you can retrieve the ad-related statistics that apply to a set. See Optimized CPM and Promoted Object.

For example, create an ad set with a daily budget:

Housing, Employment and Credit Ads

Facebook is committed to protecting people from discrimination, and we are continually improving our ability to detect and deter potential abuse. Itâ€™s already against our policies to discriminate by wrongfully targeting or excluding specific groups of people. As part of a historic settlement agreement, we are making changes to the way we manage housing, employment and credit ads.


Advertisers must specify a special_ad_category for ad campaigns that market housing, employment, and credit. In doing so, the set of targeting options available for ads in these campaigns will be restricted. See Special Ad Category for more information.

Targeting European Union Ads

Beginning Tuesday, May 16, 2023 advertisers who include the European Union (EU), associated territories, or select global/worldwide in their ad targeting on Facebook and Instagram will be asked to include information about who benefits from the ad (the beneficiary) and who is paying for the ad (the payor) for each ad set. Advertisers will be prompted for this information in all ads buying surfaces including Ads Manager and the Marketing API. Beginning Wednesday, August 16, 2023, if beneficiary and payer information is not provided, the ad will not be published.


We are launching this requirement to respond to the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) which goes into full effect for Facebook and Instagram later this year.


Ad sets targeted to the EU and/or associated territories (see here for a complete list) are required to provide beneficiary information (who benefits from the ad running), and payer information (who pays for the ad). This applies to new ads, duplicated ads, or significantly edited ads from May 16 forward, and without the required information, the API will respond with a wrong parameter error. For convenience the advertiser can set a saved beneficiary and payor in their ad account, which will be auto-populated during ad set creation, copying, and updating targets to include EU locations and ads under existing ad seta without configured the payor and beneficiary.. For more information about the ad account level parameters, default_dsa_payor and default_dsa_beneficiary, see to the check the Ad Account reference document.


To facilitate the creation of ad sets targeting the EU, we're offering a new API which allows developers to get a list of likely beneficiary/payer strings, based on ad account activity. See Ad Account DSA Recommendations for more information.


Notice:

When the default values are set in the ad account, during ad set creation, updating, and ad creation under an existing ad set, if one of them is not provided, the API will automatically fill the default value listed in the ad account. Do not pass only one of them and expect the API to set the other one to be the same value. For example, in the ad account settings, default_dsa_payor is payor_default and default_dsa_beneficiary is beneficiary_default. During ad set creation, if only dsa_payor is passed with the payor, the dsa_beneficiary will be automatically filled with value of beneficiary_default instead of dsa_payor.
If no saved default values are set or the values are unset, without explicitly passing the payor or beneficiary during ad set creation or when making updates, it will trigger an error and the request will fail.
The payer and the beneficiary fields are only for ad sets targeting the EU and/or associated territories.
For ad sets targeting regions other than the EU and/or associated territories, that information will not be saved even if it is provided.
To facilitate the creation of ad sets targeting the EU, we're offering a new API which allows developers to get a list of likely beneficiary/payer strings, based on ad account activity. See Ad Account Dsa Recommendations for more information.

Reading
An ad set is a group of ads that share the same daily or lifetime budget, schedule, bid type, bid info, and targeting data. Ad sets enable you to group ads according to your criteria, and you can retrieve the ad-related statistics that apply to a set.

The date_preset = lifetime parameter is disabled in Graph API v10.0 and replaced with date_preset = maximum, which returns a maximum of 37 months of data. For v9.0 and below, date_preset = maximum will be enabled on May 25, 2021, and any lifetime calls will default to maximum and return only 37 months of data.

bid_adjustments
AdBidAdjustments
Map of bid adjustment types to values

bid_amount
unsigned int32
Bid cap or target cost for this ad set. The bid cap used in a lowest cost bid strategy is defined as the maximum bid you want to pay for a result based on your optimization_goal. The target cost used in a target cost bid strategy lets Facebook bid on your behalf to meet your target on average and keep costs stable as you raise budget.

The bid amount's unit is cents for currencies like USD, EUR, and the basic unit for currencies like JPY, KRW. The bid amount for ads with IMPRESSION or REACH as billing_event is per 1,000 occurrences of that event, and the bid amount for ads with other billing_events is for each occurrence.

bid_constraints
AdCampaignBidConstraint
Choose bid constraints for ad set to suit your specific business goals. It usually works together with bid_strategy field.

bid_info
map<string, unsigned int32>
Map of bid objective to bid value.

bid_strategy
enum {LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP, COST_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS}
Bid strategy for this ad set when you use AUCTION as your buying type:
LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal without limiting your bid amount. This is the best strategy if you care most about cost efficiency. However with this strategy it may be harder to get stable average costs as you spend. This strategy is also known as automatic bidding. Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost.
LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal while limiting actual bid to your specified amount. With a bid cap you have more control over your cost per actual optimization event. However if you set a limit which is too low you may get less ads delivery. Get your bid cap with the field bid_amount. This strategy is also known as manual maximum-cost bidding. Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost.
Notes:

If you enable campaign budget optimization, you should get bid_strategy at the parent campaign level.
TARGET_COST bidding strategy has been deprecated with Marketing API v9.

During creation and update, the passed identities fields need to correspond to declared categories.

To update an existing ad set identities, you need to pass new values for both categories and identities to overwrite the identity id or null to remove existing id.

For example:

Upon creation, regional_regulated_categories is [TAIWAN_FINSERV, TAIWAN_UNIVERSAL] and regional_regulation_identities is

regional_regulation_identities: { "taiwan_finserv_beneficiary": <id_123>, "taiwan_finserv_payer": <id_123>, "taiwan_universal_beneficiary": <id_456>, "taiwan_universal_payer": <id_456>, }

For update, passing [TAIWAN_UNIVERSAL] and regional_regulation_identities: { "taiwan_finserv_beneficiary": null "taiwan_finserv_payer": null, "taiwan_universal_beneficiary": <id_789>, "taiwan_universal_payer": <id_789>, }

For example display first ad in Adgroup for first date range, second ad for second date range, and so on. You can display more than one ad per date range by providing more than one ad ID per array. For example set time_based_ad_rotation_id_blocks to [[1], [2, 3], [1, 4]]. On the first date range show ad 1, on the second date range show ad 2 and ad 3 and on the last date range show ad 1 and ad 4. Use with time_based_ad_rotation_intervals to specify date ranges.

time_based_ad_rotation_intervals
list<unsigned int32>
Date range when specific ad creative displays during a campaign. Provide date ranges in an array of UNIX timestamps where each timestamp represents the start time for each date range. For example a 3-day campaign from May 9 12am to May 11 11:59PM PST can have three date ranges, the first date range starts from May 9 12:00AM to May 9 11:59PM, second date range starts from May 10 12:00AM to May 10 11:59PM and last starts from May 11 12:00AM to May 11 11:59PM. The first timestamp should match the campaign start time. The last timestamp should be at least 1 hour before the campaign end time. You must provide at least two date ranges. All date ranges must cover the whole campaign length, so any date range cannot exceed campaign length. Use with time_based_ad_rotation_id_blocks to specify ad creative for each date range.

Considerations
Bid/Budget Validations
Note:

All values in this section are in US Dollars.
Differenct currencies have different minimum daily budget limits.
Minimum values are defined in terms of the daily budget but apply to lifetime budgets as well.
Minimum budget takes the total spent budget into account.
When creating an ad set, there will be a minimum budget for different billing events (Clicks, Impressions, Actions). If the minimum daily budget is $5, a campaign lasting 5 days will need at least $25 for budget.
Budget amounts shown are for illustrative purposes only and can change based on situation.

If bid_strategy is set to LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP in the ad set:

Billing Event	Minimum Daily Budget
Impressions

$0.50

Clicks/Likes/Video Views

$2.50

Low-frequency Actions
(Includes mobile app installs, offer claims, or canvas app installs)

$40
Important: This minimum daily budget is the same for all countries.

If bid_strategy is set to LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP in the ad set:

Billing Event	Minimum Daily Budget
Impressions

At least the bid_amount. For example, if the bid amount is $10, then $10 will be the minimum budget required.

Clicks/Actions

5x the bid_amount for a Click or Action. For example, if the bid amount is $5 per click/action, then $25 will be the minimum budget required.

Budgets in non-USD currencies will be converted and validated upon time of ad set creation.

For ads belonging to ad accounts from countries in the list below, the minimum values are 2x the ones in the tables. For example, if the billing event is an Impression, the minimum daily budget is $0.50, but in the the following countries the minimum would be $1.00:

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States of America.

The only exception to this rule are Low-Frequency Actions when bid_strategy is LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP.

Locale targeted page post
If you promote a Page post which has been targeted by locale the ad set targeting must include the same, or a subset of, locale targeting as the Page post.

E.g. if the Page post is targeted at locales 6 (US English) and 24 (UK English), then the ad set must be targeted at one or more of the same locales.

Mobile App Ads
Mobile app ad sets should

be used in conjunction with targeting spec fields user_device and user_os
have a MOBILE_APP_* objective on the campaign
Desktop App Ads
Desktop app ad sets must

include a targeting spec of either
'page_types':['desktopfeed'] or
'page_types':['rightcolumn'] or
'page_types':['desktop'] along with the other targeting options you have selected.
include a CANVAS_APP_* objective
Lookalike Expansion
Beginning with v13.0, for newly created ad sets that optimize for value, conversions, or app events, lookalike expansion will be turned on by default and cannot be disabled. When getting an ad set that optimizes for value, conversions, or app events, we will return a new lookalike property in the targeting_optimization_types map that indicates lookalike expansion is enabled and complements the existing detailed_targeting property for the detailed targeting expansion.

Targeting DSA Regulated Locations (EU)
For ad sets targeting the EU and/or associated territories, the dsa_payor and dsa_beneficiary fields are required. The information provided in these 2 fields will be shown to end users to indicate who is paying for the ad and who is the beneficiary of the ad.

Parameters
Parameter	Description
adlabels
list<Object>
Specifies list of labels to be associated with this object. This field is optional

adset_schedule
list<Object>
Ad set schedule, representing a delivery schedule for a single day

attribution_spec
list<JSON object>
Conversion attribution spec used for attributing conversions for optimization. Supported window lengths differ by optimization goal and campaign objective.

automatic_manual_state
enum{UNSET, AUTOMATIC, MANUAL}
automatic_manual_state

bid_amount
integer
Bid cap or target cost for this ad set. The bid cap used in a lowest cost bid strategy is defined as the maximum bid you want to pay for a result based on your optimization_goal. The target cost used in a target cost bid strategy lets Facebook bid to meet your target on average and keep costs stable as you spend. If an ad level bid_amount is specified, updating this value will overwrite the previous ad level bid. Unless you are using Reach and Frequency, bid_amount is required if bid_strategy is set to LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP or COST_CAP.
The bid amount's unit is cents for currencies like USD, EUR, and the basic unit for currencies like JPY, KRW. The bid amount for ads with IMPRESSION or REACH as billing_event is per 1,000 occurrences, and has to be at least 2 US cents or more. For ads with other billing_events, the bid amount is for each occurrence, and has a minimum value 1 US cents. The minimum bid amounts of other currencies are of similar value to the US Dollar values provided.

bid_strategy
enum{LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP, COST_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS}
Choose bid strategy for this ad set to suit your specific business goals. Each strategy has tradeoffs and may be available for certain optimization_goals:
LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal without limiting your bid amount. This is the best strategy if you care most about cost efficiency. However with this strategy it may be harder to get stable average costs as you spend. This strategy is also known as automatic bidding. Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost.
LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP: Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal while limiting actual bid to your specified amount. With a bid cap you have more control over your cost per actual optimization event. However if you set a limit which is too low you may get less ads delivery. If you select this, you must provide a bid cap with the bid_amount field. Note: during creation this bid strategy is set if you provide bid_amount only. This strategy is also known as manual maximum-cost bidding. Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost.

Notes:

If you enable campaign budget optimization, you should set bid_strategy at the parent campaign level.

TARGET_COST bidding strategy has been deprecated with Marketing API v9.

PHP SDKPython SDKcURL
use FacebookAds\Object\AdSet;

PHP SDKPython SDKcURL
use FacebookAds\Object\AdSet;

$adset = new AdSet('<AD_SET_ID>');
$adset->campaign_status = AdSet::STATUS_PAUSED;
$adset->update();
Remarks
An archived ad set can only update two fields: name and campaign_status. The campaign_status field can only be changed to DELETED.

A deleted ad set can only change its name.

There are two considerations to take into account when adjusting an ad set's budget value or budget type:

When updating a set's lifetime or daily budget to a lower value, the new value must be at least 10% greater than the current amount spent already. For example: if an ad set has a $1000 lifetime budget and has spend $300 so far, the lowest new lifetime budget would be $330.
Since v2.4, ad sets have a minimum required budget. Any update must take that into consideration. Check the details at the Create Considerations section from this page.
Note: When using the Reservation buying type, some fields may not be available to be updated through the API.
