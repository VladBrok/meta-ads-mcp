Graph API Version
v22.0
Campaign
A campaign is the highest level organizational structure within an ad account and should represent a single objective for an advertiser, for example, to drive page post engagement. Setting objective of the campaign will enforce validation on any ads added to the campaign to ensure they also have the correct objective.

The date_preset = lifetime parameter is disabled in Graph API v10.0 and replaced with date_preset = maximum, which returns a maximum of 37 months of data. For v9.0 and below, date_preset = maximum will be enabled on May 25, 2021, and any lifetime calls will default to maximum and return only 37 months of data.

Limits
You can only create 200 ad sets per ad campaign. Learn more about the ad campaign structure.
If your campaign has more than 70 ad sets and uses Campaign Budget Optimization, you are not able to edit your current bid strategy or turn off CBO. Learn more in the Business Help Center.
New Required Field for All Campaigns
All businesses using the Marketing API must identify whether or not new and edited campaigns belong to a Special Ad Category. Current available categories are: housing, employment, credit, or issues, elections, and politics. Businesses whose ads do not belong to a Special Ad Category must indicate NONE or send an empty array in the special_ad_categories field.

Businesses running housing, employment, or credit ads must comply with targeting and audience restrictions. Targeting for ads about social issues, elections or politics are not affected by the special_ad_categories label.

As of Marketing API 7.0, the special_ad_category parameter on the POST /act_<ad_account_id>/campaigns endpoint has been deprecated and replaced with a new special_ad_categories parameter. The new special_ad_categories parameter is required and accepts an array.

If you use the special_ad_category parameter, it will still return a string, but you should use GET /{campaign-id}?fields=special_ad_categories to get an array back. Refer to Special Ad Category for additional information.

Reading
A campaign is a grouping of ad sets which are organized by the same business objective. Each campaign has an objective that must be valid across the ad sets within that campaign.

After your ads begin delivering, you can query stats for ad campaigns. The statistics returned will be unique stats, deduped across the ad sets. You can also get reports and statistics for all ad sets and ads in an campaign simultaneously.

Objectives and Tracking Specs
Tracking specs are applied by default based on the objective specified, please see the full list of defaults by objective here.

There are two important scenarios to take into account:

Tracking pixels are not applied by default, and you must specify it explicitly when your objective is CONVERSIONS.
Mobile app ads will no longer track installs or app events by default. You must explicitly specify to track installs or app events for mobile app ads otherwise your ad will not track.
To specify to track an install or app event, set the following in your ad:

tracking_specs=[{'action.type':['mobile_app_install'],'application':[{your_app_id}]},{'action.type':['app_custom_event'],'application':[{your_app_id}]}]

Objective, Optimization Goal and attribution_spec
Use click-through and view-through attribution windows for ad set to track conversions then use for ads delivery optimization. This is different from the attribution window you use for ads reporting. With attribution_spec, select a combination of click-through or view-through windows of 1 day or 7 days. The combinations you can use depend on your ad set's optimization_goal and campaign's objective.

Recommended Default attribution_spec

You may not have provided attribution_spec when you created ads sets optimized for Value Optimization. This is an optimization available for conversions, app installs, and product catalog sales objectives. In the past, we defaulted to a 1-day click through attribution window.

Objective	Optimization Goal	Allowed Combination
CONVERSIONS, PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES

OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS

1-day click


7-day click


1-day click and 1-day view

CONVERSIONS

INCREMENTAL_OFFSITE_ CONVERSIONS

Null click, Null view

For all other optimization_goal and objective combinations, you can only use 1-day click for attribution_spec.

Outcome-Driven Ads Experiences Objective Validation
From v20.0 onwards, Impressions optimization goal is deprecated for the legacy Post Engagement objective and the ON_POST destination_type.

Objective values
The following are newer objectives:

OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION
OUTCOME_AWARENESS
OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT
OUTCOME_LEADS
OUTCOME_SALES
OUTCOME_TRAFFIC
These newer objectives will eventually replace the original objectives APP_INSTALLS, BRAND_AWARENESS, CONVERSIONS, EVENT_RESPONSES, LEAD_GENERATION, LINK_CLICKS, LOCAL_AWARENESS, MESSAGES, OFFER_CLAIMS, PAGE_LIKES, POST_ENGAGEMENT, PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES, REACH, STORE_VISITS, VIDEO_VIEWS. We will continue supporting these original objectives throughout 2022.

Limitations
Trying to duplicate existing objective campaigns to use the new objective values (OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION, OUTCOME_AWARENESS, OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT, OUTCOME_LEADS, OUTCOME_SALES, OUTCOME_TRAFFIC) may throw an error.
